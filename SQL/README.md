[Warby Parker](https://www.warbyparker.com/) is a transformative lifestyle brand with a lofty objective: to offer designer eyewear at a revolutionary price while leading the way for socially conscious businesses. Founded in 2010 and named after two characters in an early Jack Kerouac journal, Warby Parker believes in creative thinking, smart design, and doing good in the world — for every pair of eyeglasses and sunglasses sold, a pair is distributed to someone in need.

Codeflix, a streaming video startup, is interested in measuring their user churn rate. In this project, you’ll be helping them answer these questions about their churn:

1. Get familiar with the company.

How many months has the company been operating? Which months do you have enough information to calculate a churn rate?
What segments of users exist?
2. What is the overall churn trend since the company started?

3. Compare the churn rates between user segments.

Which segment of users should the company focus on expanding?
