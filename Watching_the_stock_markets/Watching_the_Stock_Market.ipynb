    "### Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "You are asked by a company to help them make more informed decisions on investments. To start, you will be watching the stock market, collecting data, and identifying trends!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hosting your project\n",
    "\n",
    "Using DB Browser for SQLite as a visual tool for working with SQLite databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "- SQLite can store an entire database in a single file, which usually has a .sqlite or .db extension. To open a database, select Open Database at the top of the window and browse for the file. Alternatively, you can choose to create a New Database by saving a file with the .sqlite or .db extension.\n",
    "- To import data from a CSV file into a table, select “File > Import > Table from CSV file…” and browse for the CSV file. (Note: All fields imported from the CSV file will have a data type of TEXT. Be sure to convert fields to numeric type as needed)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s break this project down into a couple different parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Manipulation: Collect data on your pick of 5 stocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create a table called stocks, where you will be inserting your data.\n",
    "- The stocks table should have a column for symbol, name, datetime, and price.\n",
    "- Collect your data! Choose 3 times throughout the day to document the price of each stock and continue for at least 1 week. You can do this moving forward, or just take a retroactive look at the stock market by taking data historically from regular intervals (e.g. the first of the month for the last six months)."
