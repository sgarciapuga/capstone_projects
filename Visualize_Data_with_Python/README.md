## Create a Slide Deck

Create a slide deck using Google Drive , Microsoft Powerpoint, or some other presentation software. Your presentation should include the following:

- A title slide
- A list of your visualizations and your role in their creation for the “Stock Profile” team
- A visualization of the distribution of the stock prices for Netflix in 2017

- A section sharing the background info (definition of GDP for example) and sources for your data as well as any further research you conducted

- An accompanying paragraph describing the following visualizations:

  - The violin plot of the life expectancy distribution by country
  - The facet grid of scatter graphs mapping GDP as a function of Life Expectancy by country
  - The facet grid of line graphs mapping GDP by country
  - The facet grid of line graphs mapping Life Expectancy by country
