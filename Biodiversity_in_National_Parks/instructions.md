# Capstone Project: Biodiversity in National Parks

Analyze data about endangered species.

For this project, you’ll act as a data analyst for the National Park Service. You’ll be helping them analyze data on endangered species from several different parks.

The National Parks Service would like you to perform some data analysis on the conservation statuses of these species and to investigate if there are any patterns or themes to the types of species that become endangered. During this project, you will analyze, clean up, and plot data, pose questions and seek to answer them in a meaningful way.

After you perform analysis, you’ll be creating a presentation to share your findings with the National Park Service.

## Create a Slide Deck

Your presentation should include the following:

- A title slide
- A section describing the data in species_info.csv. Be sure to include some (or all) of what you noticed while working through the notebook.
- A section describing the significance calculations that you did for endangered status between different categories of species.
- A recommendation for conservationists concerned about endangered species, based on your significance calculations
- A section describing the sample size determination that you did for the foot and mouth disease study
- All of the graphs that you created in the notebook

# Capstone Project: MuscleHub A/B Test


You’ve been hired to help MuscleHub, a fancy gym, run an A/B test!

Currently, when a visitor to MuscleHub is considering buying a membership, he or she follows the following steps:

1. Take a fitness test with a personal trainer
2. Fill out an application for the gym
3. Send in their payment for their first month’s membership
4. Janet, the manager of MuscleHub, thinks that the fitness test intimidates some prospective members, so she has set up an A/B test.

Visitors will randomly be assigned to one of two groups:

- Group A will still be asked to take a fitness test with a personal trainer
- Group B will skip the fitness test and proceed directly to the application

Janet’s hypothesis is that visitors assigned to Group B will be more likely to eventually purchase a membership to MuscleHub.

You will help her analyze the data and create a presentation.

### Qualitative Data

In the file interviews.txt, there are interviews with a few different gym visitors who participated in the A/B test. Read them and see if they help you better understand the results of the test.

## Create a Slide Deck

Your presentation should include the following:

- A title slide
- A description of what happened in this A/B test
- A summary of your dataset and any information you think would be helpful background
- The results of the three hypothesis tests that you ran, including an explanation of the type of test that you used and why it was appropriate
- A summary of the qualitative data
- A recommendation for MuscleHub
