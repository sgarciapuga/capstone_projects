# Twitter Classification Cumulative Project: 


There are two parts to this project that can be done in either order.

In the [first part](https://github.com/sgarciapuga/capstone_projects/blob/master/Machine_Learning/viral_tweets.ipynb), you will make a system that predicts whether or not a tweet will go viral by using a K-Nearest Neighbor classifier. What features of a tweet do you think are the most important in determining its virality? Does the length of the tweet matter? What about the number of hashtags? Maybe information about the account that sent the tweet is most important. You’ll answer these questions while using DataFrames and Matplotlib visualizations to present your results!

In the [second part](https://github.com/sgarciapuga/capstone_projects/blob/master/Machine_Learning/tweet_location.ipynb) of this project, you’ll test the power of Naive Bayes classifiers by creating a system that predicts whether a tweet was sent from New York City, London, or Paris. You will investigate how language is used differently in these three cities. Can the classifier automatically detect the difference between French and English? Can it learn local phrases or slang? Can you create tweets that trick the system?

# Masculinity Survey Cumulative Project: 

Welcome to the cumulative project for clustering! In this project, you will use a survey conducted by 538 to find patterns in the way men view masculinity.

Slide Presentation

In recent years, there has been a massive rise in the usage of dating apps to find love. Many of these apps use sophisticated data science techniques to recommend possible matches to users and to optimize the user experience. These apps give us access to a wealth of information that we’ve never had before about how different people experience romance.

In this capstone, you will analyze some data from OKCupid, an app that focuses on using multiple choice and short answers to match users.

## Introduction

In this capstone, you will create a presentation about your findings in this OkCupid dataset.

The purpose of this capstone is to practice formulating questions and implementing Machine Learning techniques to answer those questions. We will give you guidance about the kinds of questions we asked, and the kinds of methods we used to answer those questions. But the questions you ask and how you answer them are entirely up to you. We’re excited to see what kinds of different things you explore. Compared to the other projects you have completed this far, we are requiring few restrictions on how you structure your code. The project is far more open-ended, and you should use your creativity. In addition, much of the code you write for later parts of this project will depend on how you decided to implement earlier parts. Therefore, we strongly encourage you to read through the entire assignment before writing any code.

The dataset provided has the following columns of multiple-choice data:

- body_type
- diet
- drinks
- drugs
- education
- ethnicity
- height
- income
- job
- offspring
- orientation
- pets
- religion
- sex
- sign
- smokes
- speaks
- status

And a set of open short-answer responses to :

- essay0 - My self summary
- essay1 - What I’m doing with my life
- essay2 - I’m really good at
- essay3 - The first thing people usually notice about me
- essay4 - Favorite books, movies, show, music, and food
- essay5 - The six things I could never do without
- essay6 - I spend a lot of time thinking about
- essay7 - On a typical Friday night I am
- essay8 - The most private thing I am willing to admit
- essay9 - You should message me if…
